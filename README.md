# Spotify Visualiser (Proof of Concept)

This is a proof of concept for my final year project (For more details please see the actual microservice repositories). The reason to designate this repository as a proof of concept was a complete change of backend technologies and the decision use the microservice architecture. The change from a relational database to a No-SQL database was a another key change. I have kept this repository to demonstate the progession of the project.
